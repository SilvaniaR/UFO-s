## Overview of analysis:
We created a webpage with dynamic tables to be able to filter information from our data file. At first we created a table that only filter by date. We later then wanted the user to be able to filter the data by various elements such as city , state, country and shape of UFO.

## Results:

## Summary:
One drawback about this webpage is that is unbale to resize based on which device is used ie: phone vs browser.Therefore one of the recomendation is to format the web page to resize based on device being used. Another suggestion to add to this web page is a form where users can add their UFO experience if any. This would further expand our database on UFO sightings, we would create a form similar to the table for the user to enter.
